- [X] 0.1 IM parity
  - [X] timing adaptor
- [ ] 0.5: publishable post
  - [ ] Code
    - [ ] Functionality going beyond IM?
      - candidates:
	- structured logging and analysis via serde
	- expanded sampling (exponential from start and end, weighted reservoir)
	- expand trait:
	  - cost function?
	  - solution extraction function?
	- adaptor for quantifying convergence rates? a shim around that for testing performance?
	- support for frame based profiling?
    - [ ] Can we add impl-style adaptors from outside the streaming-iterator crate?
  - [ ] Decide format and focus
    - [ ] Side post walking through the process of exploring an algorithm using the adaptors?
  - [ ] Fill out content
- [ ] 0.8 publish post, get feedback.
  - [ ] Clean up repo
  - [ ] Publish. reddit? ndarray/ml hangouts?
  - [ ] Apply feedback
- [ ] 1.0 decision point
  - [ ] Decide whether this is a single post repo or we expand on the project.
