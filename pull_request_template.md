# Intent:

<Explain the goal of the PR for the implementation to be judged
against. Link to relevant context including issues, papers, etc>

<Survey coverage by existing or new tests, create a checklist for
uncovered changes. For changes impractical to test, list them and
consider a demo for human checking.>
  
# State of PR
<Check boxes when done>
- [ ] Rustdoc and implementation comments?
